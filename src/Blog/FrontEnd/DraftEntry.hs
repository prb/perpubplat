Design for draft management: 

- Drafts consist of title, tags, body, and summary.

- Workflow for a draft (to publish it, to validate it as XHTML, when to publish it, etc.) is
  separate from the editing view.

- Drafts are stored in a single directory and managed by a set of
  structures akin to the CommentQueue/CommentController pair.
