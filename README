This file explains how to build perpubplat. This is not for the
uninitiated or faint of heart, and I'll assume that you've got a good
level of familiarity with Apache (or some other FastCGI container like
lighttpd), Haskell, and standard *nix environments. (That said, what
you don't know is probably readily available by Googling.)

The "per" in perpubplat is for "personal", and I haven't gone out of
my way to make perpubplat configurable or customizable beyond my
immediate purposes. That said, I do intend to continue making
enhancements and customizations. On my roadmap:

- Better configuration (properties versus compiled in)
- Draft management (AtomPub and web interface)
- Threaded comments
- HTTP referer management
- Component management (turn off sidebar components, etc.)


PREREQUISITES

You will need:

- GHC 6.8.3

- cabal-install (0.5.2 or greater)

- FastCGI libraries, installed somewhere your linker will know how to
  find them.  Download the source from http://www.fastcgi.com/

I will track the latest released version of GHC, so expect a bump when
new versions of GHC are released.


GETTING SOURCE

The git repository for perpubplat is hosted at github:

  http://github.com/prb/perpubplat

To clone the repository, do:

  $ git clone git://github.com/prb/perpubplat.git

Or you can ask github to make you a tarball.


CONFIGURING

All of the relevant configuration parameters are in the Blog.Constants
module in the perpubplat library.


BUILDING

The libraries and executables all build the standard cabal-install
way, e.g.:

  $ cd perpubplat
  $ cabal install

This places the perpubplat.fcgi executable in ~/.cabal/bin. If you
want the executable in a different location:

  $ cd perpubplat
  $ cabal install --prefix=/path/to/other/location


RUNNING

Point your favorite FastCGI web container at perpubplat.fcgi.  Some
help selecting and configuring a container is available from here:

http://mult.ifario.us/p/wiring-haskell-into-a-fastcgi-web-server

Some sample Apache2 configuration fragments are included in the
repository.

*** NB: It is critically important that only one perpubplat.fcgi
process is running at a time, so configure the web container
accordingly. ***
